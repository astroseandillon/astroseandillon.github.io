Hello, My name is Sean Dillon. I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at San Antonio, studying astrophysics. I recently graduated from California State University, Chico, with a Bachelors of Science in Physics with a minor in Mathematics. My current research interests include Galaxy Evolution, Observational Instrumentation, and Computational Modeling.

When I'm not working on homework and/or yelling at my code, you can often find me enjoying a nice hike outdoors. Otherwise, I'm playing Dungeons and Dragons with my roommates.
