Hello, my name is Sean Dillon. I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at San Antonio, studying astrophysics. I recently graduated from California State University, Chico, with a Bachelors of Science in Physics with a minor in Mathematics. My current research interests include galaxy evolution, observational instrumentation, and computational modeling.

When I'm not working on homework and/or working on debugging my code, you can often find me enjoying a nice hike outdoors. Otherwise, I'm playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends and former roommates.
