Hello, My name is Sean Dillon. I am a senior at California State University, Chico, studying physics. I am set to graduate in May 2020 with my bachelors in Physics. I hope to be attending graduate school in the near future with a focus in astronomy and astrophysics. My current research interests include Galaxy Evolution, Observational Instrumentation, and Computational Modeling.

When I'm not working on homework and/or cussing out my code, you can often find me enjoying a nice hike outdoors. Otherwise, I'm playing Dungeons and Dragons with my roommates.
