# A Brief Research History

_In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move._

-Douglas Adams

## Computational Astrophysics
When I was in high school, I had to interview an astrophysicist for my senior project. A bit of advice he gave me was to get really good at python programming. Fast forward to the present day, and I think I have a relatively decent amount of experience in computation (or, at the very least, in googling stuff until it works).

Computational Astrophysics is the study and usage of computers in the field of astrophysics. Computers are used for data processing, statistical analysis, modeling, observing, and learning (terrifyingly). I use python for my research because it is relatively easy to use, simple, and understandable. I do have a laundry list of other languages that I'd like to start learning about, including Fortran, C++, and R. I will get around to learning these as the need arises. Using python, I have been able to model solar convection, use machine-learning algorithms, and made spectra of stars.
